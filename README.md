# Multi Option Filter

This is an example wherein I am implementing an E-commerce-style multiple option filter. I am pulling the data from faker.js and the filtering is based on the product department, product price and the product color.

The backend is built using Express.js and the frontend is built using React. The database is from MongoDB Atlas.
